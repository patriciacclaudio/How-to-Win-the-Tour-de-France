**How to Win the Tour de France - A Data Science Project**

**Project Overview**

This project investigates the key physiological and structural factors contributing to success in the Tour de France. Using historical data (1903â€“2024), it applies data analysis and visualisation to uncover trends in rider attributes, race design, and winning strategies. The aim is to inform athlete development and team tactics in elite cycling.

**Key Questions**

How have rider attributes (age, weight, height) evolved over time?
What race structure changes have influenced outcomes?
Is there a physiological "winning profile"?

**Tools**

Language: Python 3.10
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, unicodedata
Platform: Google Colab

**Data Sources**

ProCyclingStats
Kaggle Dataset
